Tracking changes in the tech radar over time. Data comes from http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar

Data is scraped by hand and may have errors

In the January 2012 data set, items between two zones are in the data set as in in the outer zone of the two they straddle.

Goals: 
see "current" recommendations by aggregating old recommendations
turn data into json which can be worked with by others
enable future turning of data into json

anticipated data structure:
- tech name
- - radar mentioned
- - - classification (adopt/hold/etc), type (platform, language, etc), number

data = {'tech name 1' => {'radar 1' => ['classification1', 'type1', 1]}}
